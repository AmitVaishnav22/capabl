# Secure Video Player App

This is a secure, mobile-friendly video player built using **Expo (React Native)** for the MEL Labs internship assessment. It features dynamic watermarking, screenshot detection, playback restrictions in secure mode, and a clean UI.

---

## Features Implemented

###  Security
-  Dynamic watermark (username + timestamp, updates every 30s)
-  Watermark shuffles position to prevent cropping
-  Screenshot detection with alert + pause
-  Screenshot count tracking (session-wise)

###  Video Player
-  Plays `.mp4` videos (web & mobile compatible)
-  Full playback controls (play/pause, seek, volume)
-  Fullscreen support
-  Replaces native controls in `secureMode` with:
  - 5s rewind
  - ‚ñ∂/‚è∏ play-pause

### Additional Features
-  Settings screen for watermark + secureMode toggle
-  Status screen shows:
  - Screenshot protection ON/OFF
  - Watermark settings
  - Screenshot count

## üõ† Tech Stack

- React Native (Expo)
- `expo-av` for video playback
- `expo-media-library` for screenshot polling
- React Context API for global state management

---

##  Setup Instructions

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AmitVaishnav22/capabl.git
cd secure-video-app

Install dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm install
Run the app:

bash
Copy
Edit
npx expo start
For web testing: press w

For device: scan QR with Expo Go app

How to Test Screenshot Detection
Screenshot detection only works on real devices (not web or emulator)

Run the app on a physical device using Expo Go

Play the video in Player Screen

Take a screenshot

The app will:

Show a warning popup

Pause the video

Increment screenshot attempt count

Known Limitations
Screenshot detection is a workaround using MediaLibrary; native prevention is not possible on Expo.

Fast-forward restriction based on manual position checking.

Does not support local file uploads (sample video only).

# Technical Notes ‚Äì Secure Video App

## üèõ Architecture Decisions

- **Expo (React Native)** was chosen for its fast setup, cross-platform support, and ease of deployment.
- Used **React Context API** for managing global settings like `username`, `secureMode`, and `screenshotCount`.
- **Component Structure**:
  - `VideoPlayer`: Core video component with watermark overlay + secure mode handling
  - `PlayScreen`: Orchestrates screenshot detection and playback restriction
  - `SettingsScreen`: Updates watermark and security toggle
  - `StatusScreen`: Shows real-time session info
  - `ScreenShotDetector`: Utility polling `MediaLibrary` every 3s

---

##  Security Approach

- **Dynamic Watermarking**:
  - Watermark contains username + timestamp
  - Changes position every 30 seconds to avoid cropping
  - Semi-transparent overlay styled via `rgba`

- **Screenshot Detection**:
  - Uses `expo-media-library` to scan new screenshots every 3 seconds
  - Displays warning + pauses video
  - Updates screenshot count via context

- **Playback Restrictions (Secure Mode)**:
  - Disables native controls
  - Replaces with custom play/pause and 10s rewind
  - Blocks excessive fast-forwarding by monitoring playback delta

---

## What I‚Äôd Improve With More Time

- Switch to native build and use native screenshot detection APIs (e.g., Android `FLAG_SECURE`)
- Add persistent storage using `AsyncStorage` or backend sync
- Support user video uploads or video list picker
- Improve test coverage and error handling

---

## Notes

- Tested on Web and Android using Expo Go
- Used `uri`-based video source for web compatibility
- Designed UI to be clean and mobile-friendly with touch-safe buttons
